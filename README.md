I want the application to be a RPG battle featuring three classes selectable as protagonist. Namely, Orcs, Dwarves, and Elves. 
Featuring unique battle methods unique to each class. The characters can perform 'behind the scenes' tasks that would grant certain amount of rewards upon re-entering (login) to the game. 
Enemies will feature humanities of various mutations, shown in map as 'infected sites'. Clearing these infected sites is the main goal for the game. 
Disinfecting a site will grant certain amount of buff to the general gameplay.
